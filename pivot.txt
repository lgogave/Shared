Introduction: "We are currently using a single-window application for our Workforce Management (WFM) reporting, with the reporting structure divided into geographical and vertical categories. For today's demonstration, we will focus on the 'Travel' vertical."

Vertical Selection and Navigation: "Once we select the Travel vertical, you'll notice a variety of reporting options such as Real-Time Reports, Resource Planner Inputs and Outputs, Trends, and a Vertical Snapshot. For this demo, we’ll choose the Real-Time Report option."

Summary View: "This action takes us to a summary page, where key day-level metrics such as Service Level Percentage (SL%) and Shrinkage Percentage are displayed. These provide an at-a-glance overview of current performance."

Detailed View – Real-Time Report: "Now, let's drill down into the details by clicking on the 'RTA' option. Here, you can see a comprehensive report with detailed information, presented in both chart and grid formats. On this first page, we display interval-wise comparisons, such as Planned vs. Actual Volume, Service Level %, and Shrinkage %. Additionally, the data is laid out in a table format, complete with RAG (Red, Amber, Green) status indicators. You also have Interval Summary and Shrinkage Summary at your disposal for a more granular view."

Filtering Capabilities: "To customize the data view, we’ve incorporated various filters such as Queue, Location, Week, Month, and Date. This helps you easily narrow down the information according to your specific needs."

Resource Planner Overview: "Let’s now return to the main menu and check out the Resource Planner module. This section captures all key metrics such as Required FTE, Available FTE, Planned Shrinkage, and Attrition. We’ve structured the data inputs under headers for planned assumptions to make it easier for you to input or analyze your data."

Headcount Delta Comparison: "Lastly, in the menu, you'll find a feature that allows you to compare headcount delta between multiple Lines of Business (LOBs), helping you to plan headcount more effectively and optimize staffing levels."

Closing: "In summary, this application provides a comprehensive view of workforce management across multiple dimensions, with detailed reporting options, flexible filtering, and robust planning capabilities. Let’s dive into any questions you may have."
